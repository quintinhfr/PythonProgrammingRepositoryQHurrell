This sequence of statements ends up making all of the variables end up being tied to the integer that "a" was originally connected to. I tested this in my terminal where a = 50 and b = 70, the results are below:

>>> a = 50
>>> b = 70
>>> t = a
>>> b = t
>>> a = b
>>> t
50
>>> b
50
>>> a
50

I recieved a "NameError" message that claimes that "sqrt" is not defined. This is because with adding "math", python cannot find the module that you are looking for. The error message I recieved is below:

quintinhurrell@Quintins-MacBook-Pro assignment4 % python3 quadratic.py -3.0 2.0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/quintinhurrell/Desktop/CISC120/assignment4/quadratic.py", line 9, in <module>
    d = sqrt(discriminant)
NameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined


1.2.14 -

I believe that the issue with this code is that python automatically does the order of operations wrong for. I think that the main reason that this occurs is because the coder uses (radius * radius) to show the radius being to a power to two, but this needs done first. The correct code is below:

force = (((G * mass1) * mass2) / (radius * radius))
